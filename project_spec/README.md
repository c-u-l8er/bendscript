# BendScript — Component Project Spec

BendScript is currently a **static marketing site** (`index.html`) and a reserved namespace for future workflow/DSL tooling.

## Current state

- Static site deployed via Cloudflare Pages.

## Near-term goal

- Define content and positioning that matches the portfolio architecture (OpenSentience + FleetPrompt + Graphonomous + Delegatic + A2A).

## Future (optional)

If BendScript becomes an agent/tooling component, likely scope:

- A lightweight DSL for workflows that compiles into FleetPrompt workflow definitions
- Validation and formatting tooling
- Integration with `.fleetprompt/workflows/`

No implementation commitments are made in this spec yet.
