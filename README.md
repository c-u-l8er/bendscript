the splitting and merging phrenia:
```elixir
# benben includes phrenia, bend, fold, fork, and recu marcos
# where recu indicates recursive fields
import KernelShtf.BenBen

# here is a type of brain that can be defined
phrenia BinaryTree do
  node(val, recu(left), recu(right))
  leaf()
end

# other types of brains such as linked lists are possible
phrenia List do
  cons(head, recu(tail))
  null()
end

# as well as property graphs
phrenia PropGraph do
  graph(vertex_map, recu(edge_list), metadata)
  vertex(vertex_id, properties, recu(adjacency))
  edge(source_id, target_id, edge_weight, edge_props)
  empty()
end

# this one is without weights or properties
phrenia SimpleGraph do
  graph(vertices, recu(edges))
  edge(from, to)
  empty()
end

# here is an example without recursion
phrenia Transaction do
  pending(operations, timestamp)
  committed(changes, timestamp)
  rolled_back(reason, timestamp)
end
```

what is a BenBen tho?
```text
a Benben is the only unique stone on a pyramid
that also happens to be the shape of a pyramid
and sits at the top dating back to ancient egypt.

it has similar magic to recursion because it is
also a repeated pattern with in a structure; as in
their shapes reoccur in a pattern when looping
over said struct similarly in style.

i also really like pyramids too.
i also really like 1 + 1 philosophy.
so BenBen it is!
```

when it comes to looping over the phrenia data type...

we have two methods:
- bend -> which is about recusive splitting and allocation using conditions
- fold -> which is about recusive merging and computation using cases

first, let's have a look at bend...
```elixir
# Create recursive structures using a declarative approach:
bend val = 0 do
  if val < 3 do
    BinaryTree.node(val, fork(val + 1), fork(val + 1))
  else
    BinaryTree.leaf()
  end
end

# And it also supports nested bends with different variable names:
bend i = 0 do
  bend j = 0 do
    i + j
  end
end
```

second, let's have a look at fold...
```elixir
# Stateless operation
sum = fold tree do
  case node(val, left, right) -> val + recu(left) + recu(right)
  case leaf() -> 0
end

# Stateful operation
{result, final_state} = fold list, with: 0 do
  case cons(head, tail) ->
    {tail_value, new_state} = recu(tail)
    new_sum = head + tail_value
    {head, new_sum}
  case null() -> {0, state}
end

# It should properly expand to something like:
do_fold(list, 0, fn value, state ->
  case value do
    %{variant: :cons, head: head, tail: tail} ->
      result = head + (
        {tail_result, new_state} = do_fold(tail, state, value)
        state = new_state
        tail_result
      )
      {result, state}
    %{variant: :null} ->
      {0, state}
  end
end)
```

as you can tell bend and fold are two powerful ways,
along with phrenia, of defining/working-with any type of recursive
data structure.

i got their inspiration from bendlang by Higher Order Co
they also happen to be implemented in the Haskel programming language.

now, i am still new to Elixir but i am hoping to change that with a
couple of projects. the main goal is still compsci but i'd like to
fit in at least 2 big projects as stepping stones that will hopefully
get me there.

- the first is, "DeJa: Video Ultra"
- the second is, "Thread & Burl"

i wont be registering official domain names for them to save money
instead i'll just create seperate github repos and link to this
main repo when i need to.

everything in bendscript will act as a singleton. i only have a one
old xeon machine connected to the internet that will run BEAM.

when i need more machines i will just add them as soon as i can
afford them but soon i'm hoping to save $200 a month for a couple
of mini pcs or even try getting one of those new Ryzen 16 core CPUs.

when i say act as a singleton i mean when i add more machines they
will all see each other and there will be no test or staging cluster only
a single production cluster. all BEAM nodes.

so rather than using kubernetes i will have to figure out how to
run multiple instances of the same application as well as different
applications all on a single BEAM instance/cluster.

when i happen to find a lot of money i will use these machines as
a test or staging and then use the cloud or find a nearby
datacenter and colocate :)

the plus side is that i have a fiber connection at home and can
run any kind of home setup up until i reach 5Gbps max speed connection
but i am currently paying $60 month for 500Mbps.

besides a brain for a data structure the next most and equally important
thing is memory and the ability to think or "Milestone" about on that
said memory.

```elixir
use KernelShtf.Mil

# Define initial state
magnetic do
  %{count: 0}
end

# Define synchronous calls
force(:increment, [amount]) do
  new_count = floppy.count + amount
  %{floppy | count: new_count}
end

# Define asynchronous casts
spell(:reset, []) do
  %{floppy | count: 0}
end
```

Key aspects of the Gov module demonstrated:

- `magnetic` - Defines the state structure
- `force` - Handles state calls
- `cast` - Handles state casts
- `floppy` - Gives access to data

the above is basically an elixir generic server with syntax that
will make you feel like a wizard with a magic net when you code in it.
in this case a floppy disk which contains state.

in the above example state and "magnetic floppy" mean the same thing and it
can be used as memory for your phrenia recu data types. more on
this later.

because before there were floppy disk drives there were magnetic spinning
drum drives. they spun uncontrolably similar to steem/gas engines, planets,
nuke pp, etc. and needed to be governed or they would spin out of control.
let's code a simple traffic signal below to demonstrate Gov in action.


```elixir
defmodule TrafficSignal do
  use KernelShtf.Gov
  require Logger

  fabric TrafficSignal do
    # Define initial state
    def canvas(_) do
      {:ok, %{memory: :red, rotate: %{timer: 0}}}
    end

    # Red light state
    pattern :red do
      weave :cycle do
        Logger.info("Cycling from red to green")
        weft(to: :green, drum: drum)
      end
    end

    # Green light state
    pattern :green do
      weave :cycle do
        Logger.info("Cycling from green to yellow")
        weft(to: :yellow, drum: drum)
      end
    end

    # Yellow light state
    pattern :yellow do
      weave :cycle do
        Logger.info("Cycling from yellow to red")
        weft(to: :red, drum: drum)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Key aspects of the Gov module demonstrated:

- `fabric` - Defines the state machine structure
- `pattern` - Defines state handlers
- `weave` - Pattern matches on events
- `weft` - Handles state transition
- `warp` - Handles state stay
- `drum` - Allows state to be accessed
- `drum.memory` - Gives current machine state
- `drum.rotate.<stone>` - Gives access to machine data

checkout `lib/abc_law/intersection_signal.ex` for 2 way traffic light example with timers.
checkout `lib/abc_law/vending_machine.ex` for a simple coin and inventory system.

before we get into the 4th `KernelShtf` module we are going to introduce character-driven reasoning.

```bash
# READ!!! sotries for a coninuation of this documentation :)
cat ./storeis/STORY1.md
cat ./storeis/STORY2.md
cat ./storeis/STORY3.md
```

> note: stories seams like a great way to get the compsci juices flowing. let's further refine our characters.

*(hand is to glove as foot is to sock)*

Are "is to" statemnets more harmful than "go to" statements?

The "is to" -> Analogy Statement Table (AST):

| kind | field+trait | attack | strength | defense |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|---------|
| rabbit | electromagnetism | short | strong | distributed |
| lion | gravity | long | weak | centralized |
| dragon | magic | medium | medium | balanced |

```bash
# READ!!! where we unravel the above "is to" AST's mystories
cat ./resonance_patterns/INTRO.md
cat ./resonance_patterns/SYSTEM_UNDER_STRESS.md
cat ./resonance_patterns/EMERGENT_EVOLUTION.md
```

in the above pantheon we got 3 main characters:
- Echo
- Nexus
- Harmony

let's call them the founders of our LEAGUE who are going to detect and
discover RACE. as they work together they will build RACE from scratch
starting from themselves, the knowledge that they gained from
their own "is to" -> Analogy Statement Table, and their
combined resonance patterns.

so far we have intro/structured BenBen and Mil + Gov...

the above intro/structures AST pantheons called LEAGUES...

now we are going to intro/structure stage-based
workflows aka checkpoint-based tracks called RACE...

RACE: Reward Achievement Checkpoint Engine

in Elixir this is known as GenStage, Flow, and Broadway however
we are going to simplify and codify a better solution using macros.

here is how to define a track aka "pipeline"
with checkpoints aka "producers"
```elixir
use KernelShtf.Race

track TestTrack do
  checkpoints(
    module: DummyJumper,
    checker_concurrency: 2,
    batch_size: 50
  )
end
```

quantifying DSL terminology:
- producer -> jumper
- consumer -> lander
- processor -> checker

let's define "DummyJumper" that was stated in our checkpoints module...
```elixir
defmodule TestMessage do
  defstruct [:data]
end

defmodule DummyJumper do
  use GenStage

  def start_link(opts \\ []) do
    GenStage.start_link(__MODULE__, opts)
  end

  def init(counter: counter) do
    {:jumper, counter}
  end

  def handle_demand(demand, counter) when demand > 0 do
    events = Enum.map(counter..(counter + demand - 1), &%TestMessage{data: &1})
    {:noreply, events, counter + demand}
  end
end
```

here is the MAP checkpoints (jumps and landings)...
```elixir
jump TestJump do
  def handle_demand(demand, state) do
    events = Enum.to_list(1..demand)
    {:noreply, events, state}
  end
end

land TestLand, [TestJump] do
  def handle_events(events, _from, state) do
    send(state.test_pid, {:events_received, events})
    {:noreply, [], state}
  end
end
```

here is how we can test this MAP and it's checkpoints...
```elixir
describe "jump and land" do
  test "producer-consumer communication" do
    {:ok, jumper} = TestJump.start_link([])
    {:ok, lander} = TestLand.start_link(%{test_pid: self()})

    # Wait for events
    assert_receive {:events_received, events}, 1000
    assert length(events) > 0
    assert Enum.all?(events, &is_integer/1)
  end
end
```

In Elixir, **GenStage**, **Flow**, and **Broadway** are tools for working with concurrent, parallel, and distributed data processing. Here's a comparison chart:
| Feature             | GenStage                | Flow                   | Broadway                  |
|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Abstraction Level   | Low-level primitives    | Higher-level abstraction | High-level, production-ready framework |
| Focus               | Producer-consumer stages | Data transformation   | External system integrations |
| Built-in Adapters   | No                      | No                     | Yes (e.g., SQS, RabbitMQ) |
| Use Cases           | Custom workflows        | Parallel data processing | Scalable data pipelines   |

conclusion:
- Use **GenStage** if you need fine-grained control over stage-based workflows.
- Use **Flow** for parallel data processing and stream transformations.
- Use **Broadway** for building robust, production-ready pipelines that integrate with external systems.

so far we have seen 4 modules from KernelShtf that are a key part
to what we are about to add on top next which is abstract and
concrete concepts and the ability to bridge between the two. we
are also going to add domain driven design struct on top of that which
looks something like the following in layers starting from the center
and moving outward and wraped around (spherically layered graphically).

```elixir
# layer -1 (myth)
import AbcLaw

# layer 0 (system)
import KernelShtf

# layer 1.A (mental)
import AbstractPov

# layer 1.B (physical)
import ConcreteIrl

# layer 2 (mind-body connection)
import BridgeImo

# layer 3 (core)
import XyzCore

# layer 3.X (applications)
import XyzApps.Api
import XyzApps.Web
```
> checkout `./lib` for the full source code.

reflection:
now that we have BenBen, Mil + Gov, and RACE kernel modules as well as three 10x developers (Echo, Nexus, and Harmony)
let's see if we now generate better stories that have more solid foundation of our core values.

## AI Prompt Notes
ai should:
- keep/add logging
- return only what needs to be updated
- when filling out case arguements for fold you cant use _ you must use the full variant name
- within bend and fold variable arguments must match the phrenia variable definitions
